thoughts\\nat last by notes of household harmony\\nthey quite forget their loss of liberty.\\nbut, warwick, after god, thou set'st me free,\\nand chiefly therefore i thank god and thee;\\nhe was the author, thou the instrument.\\ntherefore, that i may conquer fortune's spite\\nby living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,\\nand that the people of this blessed land\\nmay not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,\\nwarwick, although my head still wear the crown,\\ni here resign my government to thee,\\nfor thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.\\n\\nwarwick:\\nyour grace hath still been famed

then\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. i never heard of such\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\nand undoes description to do it.\\n\\nsecond gentleman:\\nwhat, pray you, became of antigonus, that carried\\nhence the child?\\n\\nthird gentleman:\\nlike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\nopen. he was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\navouches the shepherd's son;

only he hath made an essay of her\\nvirtue to practise his judgment with the disposition\\nof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,\\nhath made him that gracious denial which he is most\\nglad to receive. i am confessor to angelo, and i\\nknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to\\ndeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes\\nthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to\\nyour knees and make ready.\\n\\nclaudio:\\nlet me ask my sister pardon. i am so out of love\\nwith life that i will sue to be rid of it.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nhold you there: farewell.\\nprovost, a word with you!\\n\\nprovost:\\nwhat's your will, father\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nthat now you are come, you will be gone. leave me\\nawhile with the maid: my mind promises with my\\nhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.\\n\\nprovost:\\nin good time.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nthe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:\\nthe goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty\\nbrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of\\nyour complexion, shall keep the body of it ever\\nfair. the assault that angelo hath made to you,\\nfortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but\\nthat frailty hath examples for his falling, i should\\nwonder at angelo. how will you do to content this\\nsubstitute, and to save your brother?\\n\\nisabella:\\ni am now going to resolve him: i had rather my\\nbrother die by the law than my son should be\\nunlawfully born. but, o, how much is the good duke\\ndeceived in angelo! if ever he return and i can\\nspeak to him, i will open my lips in vain, or\\ndiscover his government.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nthat shall not be much amiss: yet, as the matter\\nnow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made\\ntrial of you only. therefore fasten your ear on my\\nadvisings: to the love i have in doing good a\\nremedy presents itself. i do make myself believe\\nthat you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged\\nlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from\\nthe angry law; do no stain to your own gracious\\nperson; and much please the absent duke, if\\nperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing of\\nthis business.\\n\\nisabella:\\nlet me hear you speak farther. i have spirit to do\\nanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nvirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. have\\nyou not heard speak of mariana, the sister of\\nfrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?\\n\\nisabella:\\ni have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nshe should this angelo have married; was affianced\\nto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between\\nwhich time of the contract and limit of the\\nsolemnity, her brother frederick was wrecked at sea,\\nhaving in that perished vessel the dowry of his\\nsister. but mark how heavily this befell to the\\npoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and\\nrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever most\\nkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of\\nher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her\\ncombinate husband, this well-seeming angelo.\\n\\nisabella:\\ncan this be so? did angelo so leave her?\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nleft her in her tears, and dried not one of them\\nwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,\\npretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,\\nbestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet\\nwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,\\nis washed with them, but relents not.\\n\\nisabella:\\nwhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\\nfrom the world! what corruption in this life, that\\nit will let this man live! but how out of this can she avail?\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nit is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the\\ncure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps\\nyou from dishonour in doing it.\\n\\nisabella:\\nshow me how, good father.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nthis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance\\nof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that\\nin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,\\nlike an impediment in the current, made it more\\nviolent and unruly. go you to angelo; answer his\\nrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree with\\nhis demands to the point; only refer yourself to\\nthis advantage, first, that your stay with him may\\nnot be long; that the time may have all shadow and\\nsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.\\nthis being granted in course,--and now follows\\nall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up\\nyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounter\\nacknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to\\nher recompense: and here, by this, is your brother\\nsaved, your honour untainted, the poor mariana\\nadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. the maid\\nwill i frame and make fit for his attempt. if you\\nthink well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\\nof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.\\nwhat think you of it?\\n\\nisabella:\\nthe image of it gives me content already; and i\\ntrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\nit lies much in your holding up. haste you speedily\\nto angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his\\nbed, give him promise of satisfaction. i will\\npresently to saint luke's: there, at the moated\\ngrange, resides this dejected mariana. at that\\nplace call upon me; and dispatch with angelo, that\\nit may be quickly.\\n\\nisabella:\\ni thank you for this comfort. fare you well, good father.\\n\\nelbow:\\nnay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will\\nneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, we\\nshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.\\n\\nduke vincentio:\\no heavens! what stuff is here\\n\\npompey:\\n'twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the\\nmerriest was put down, and the worser allowed by\\norder of law a furred gown to keep him warm;

but wheresoever, i wish him well.\\n\\nlucio:\\nit was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from\\nthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never born\\nto. lord angelo dukes it well in his absence;

We then convert our sentence into the desired input format that we already talked about. The sentence is now an array with ones or Trues, wherever a character occurs. Then we use the predict method of our model, to predict the likelihoods of the next characters. Then we make use of our sample helper function. In this function we also have a temperature parameter, which we can pass to that helper function. Of course the result we get needs to be converted from the numerical format into a readable character. Once this is done, we add the character to our generated text and repeat the process, until we reach the desired length."
